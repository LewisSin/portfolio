## Welcome to My Portfolio

Hello! I'm Lewis Sinche, and this repository houses my portfolio project developed as part of my coding journey. This portfolio is designed from scratch, showcasing my skills, projects, and a bit about who I am. Crafted with care using HTML and advanced CSS techniques like Flexbox and media queries, it's a reflection of both my technical abilities and creative vision.

## Project Overview

The portfolio features several key sections:

- **About Me**: A brief introduction to my professional background and interests.
- **Work**: Highlights of my projects, demonstrating a range of skills from web development to creative designs.
- **Contact Me**: Various ways to get in touch with me, including email and LinkedIn.

One of the core objectives of this project was to create a responsive design, ensuring the portfolio looks great on devices of all sizes.

## Development Journey

Building this portfolio from the ground up was both challenging and rewarding. It allowed me to apply core CSS skills like flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables in a real-world project. 

### Challenges

- **Responsiveness**: Ensuring a seamless layout across different devices required meticulous planning and testing.
- **Deployment**: I encountered some hurdles while trying to deploy on Heroku. Despite these challenges, I learned a lot through the process and am seeking alternative solutions for showcasing my work online.

## Looking Ahead

While the portfolio is a snapshot of my current capabilities, it's also a living document. As I continue to learn and grow, I plan to add new projects and refine the design to better reflect my evolving skill set.

## Connect With Me

I'm always open to feedback, opportunities, and collaborations. Feel free to reach out through the contact information listed in the portfolio, or follow me on GitHub to stay updated on my latest projects.
